* 1.1.0
  - Bug Fixes:
      * Adding missing error code and add api-key interpretation
  - New Features

      * discover and connect partition-leader
      * discover and connect group-coordinator
      * discover and connect transactional-coordinator
      * discover and connect cluster-controller
